# Demos

We have a couple of demos with different configurations to showcase uses diagram maker minimap plugin could be rendered for.

* **[Wide Minimap]({{ '/examples/WideMinimap.html' | relative_url }})** : Uses a container with a lower aspect ratio than the canvas.
* **[Tall Minimap]({{ '/examples/TallMinimap.html' | relative_url }})** : Uses a container with a higher aspect ratio than the canvas.

The code for these demos can be found [here](https://github.com/awslabs/diagram-maker-plugin-minimap/tree/master/integ).
