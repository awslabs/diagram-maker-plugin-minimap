# Diagram Maker Minimap Plugin
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/awslabs/diagram-maker-plugin-minimap.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/awslabs/diagram-maker-plugin-minimap)

[Diagram Maker Minimap Plugin](https://awslabs.github.io/diagram-maker-plugin-minimap) is a plugin to display a minimap for [Diagram Maker](https://github.com/awslabs/diagram-maker) to help in navigating large workspaces with lots of nodes & edges. Minimap is a smaller scale rendering of your entire canvas. This is most useful when the canvas is much larger than the container or the screeen that Diagam maker is rendering in and traversing the full canvas requires scrolling it several times. In such a case, minimap provides an overview of the full canvas along with all the nodes present in it. Furthermore, users can jump to parts of the canvas they're interested in by clicking on that area in the minimap in a single click rather than by scrolling several times.
